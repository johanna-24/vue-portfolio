            <p>Every person in life has some achievements, accomplishments, rewards and successes earned. At the same time mistakes, failures and setbacks as well. My achievements, my successes and my accomplishments are the one that make me happy and proud. Whereas, my mistakes, my failures and setbacks make me strong and bold.
            <br>
            There are various kinds of achievements one may have. There are some examples of achievements like personal achievements, academic achievements, sports achievements etc.
            <br>
            There are various roles in which one achieves something. Taking myself as an example it would be like my achievements as a teacher, my accomplishments as student in school, college or in personal life. I won't no longer narrate all the achievements I have garneredbut to simply put it up all that I was a good student and the important thing is that I was able to make my parents proud of what I have achieved so far as of this moment.</p>
